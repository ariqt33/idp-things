      <h2 class="highlight-title">Spots and Moles: What You Need to Know</h2>

      <h3>Not all moles are the same.</h3>
      <p>
        While many of us overlook common moles or skin spots, their variations in shape, size, and color can reveal vital clues about your skin health.
        Identifying these differences can help catch early signs of skin issues, including cancer. Rather than guessing through online images,
        use our AI-powered tool for a more reliable and instant assessment.
      </p>

      <h3>But first, what exactly is a mole?</h3>
      <p>
        A mole (or nevus) is a cluster of melanocytes. A melanocyte is pigment-producing cells in the skin. These spots can appear due to sun exposure
        or be present from birth. People with lighter skin tones typically have more moles due to having less melanin.
      </p>
      <p>
        On average, adults have 10 to 40 moles. They may change or increase in number due to hormonal shifts like puberty or pregnancy.
        Most are harmless, but regular self-exams (monthly if you have a family history, or every three months otherwise) are crucial to track any changes.
      </p>

      <h3>Curious about your skin type?</h3>
      <p>
        Your skin type plays a key role in determining your likelihood of developing certain skin conditions, including skin cancer.
        Our app helps you pinpoint your skin type so you can receive tailored guidance, protection strategies, and personalized care recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using your DermaCare Skin Type and Risk Profile, if you're identified as Risk or High Risk, DermaCare will design a personalized
        skin health roadmap guiding you through every step, even beyond your doctor’s visit.

      <div class="mole-type">
        <strong>Common Moles</strong>
        <p>
          Small (usually under 6 mm), clearly edged, smooth, dome-shaped, and pigmented. Usually found on sun-exposed areas and rarely become cancerous.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mole-type">
        <strong>Atypical Moles (Dysplastic Nevi)</strong>
        <p>
          These show irregular borders, inconsistent coloring, and can be flat or raised. While they may resemble precancerous lesions, most are benign.
          However, having many can increase skin cancer risk.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mole-type">
        <strong>Congenital Moles (Congenital Nevi)</strong>
        <p>
          Present from birth or within the first year. These can vary in size and may carry a risk of melanoma later in life,
          especially during adolescence and adulthood.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mole-type">
        <strong>Acquired Moles</strong>
        <p>
          Develop during childhood or adulthood, usually due to sun exposure. Generally harmless but should still be monitored for changes.

      </div>

      <div class="mole-type">
        <strong>Junctional Melanocytic Nevi</strong>
        <p>
          Form where the outer and middle skin layers meet. Slightly raised with defined borders and darker tones.
          Common from childhood to young adulthood.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mole-type">
        <strong>Intradermal Nevi</strong>
        <p>
          Blending with your natural skin tone, these are found deeper in the dermis and often appear later in life. Typically benign.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mole-type">
        <strong>Compound Nevi</strong>
        <p>
          Contain cells in both the dermis and at the junction. Usually have a raised center and flat edges with even pigmentation.

    <div class="section">
      <h3>What does skin cancer look like?</h3>
      <p><strong>Asymmetry</strong><br>
      Moles that are not small and round may carry risks. If you imagine dividing a mole in half and the two sides do not match, it is important to have it examined for potential skin cancer.</p>

      <p><strong>Border or color</strong><br>
      Check if the mole or spot has an irregular border. This is not typical for natural growth and should be evaluated. Also, if it contains colors beyond the usual brown or light brown, it is worth getting it checked.</p>

      <p><strong>Evolution</strong><br>
      Moles that undergo changes over time can be concerning. This type of evolution is not normal, so monitor them carefully. If you notice any differences, consult your doctor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Where does skin cancer appear most often?</h3>
      <p>Skin cancer can develop on any part of the skin, but it tends to occur more commonly in certain areas. This is influenced by factors like gender, genetics, and how much sun exposure a specific area receives. Some of these spots can be difficult to see on your own, so don’t hesitate to ask a partner or friend for help if necessary.</p>
